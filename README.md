# data-science-exercises

This repository contains a bunch of exercises proposed in subject _**Laboratorio de Computación Científica**_ (sort of introduction to data science) using R.

The aim of this repository is none but make some typical college exercises public so anyone can use it as a reference (most of them had a good grade, just in case you are wonder), and why not, a future reference for myself since I expect to keep using R in the future and I am not good storing commands, package names and so on in my mind :(
##Content

As said before, this subject was an introduction, so it just covered a lot of topics. Here is what you can find:

**NOTE: all folders contain an HTML file that you can visualize using your favourite browser. Anyway, most of them also include the .Rmd file (kind of the source code) that you can edit using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and export as a HTML, pdf, or .doc file using knitr**

* Association Rules:
    * Arules: some examples of computing association rules using this algorithm. .Rmd file lost, so only a HTML file is available.
    * Eclat algorithm: just a hint of what **Eclat** is.
* Clustering:
    * clustering-1, clustering-2: how to group data (similar to some machine learning tecnhiques) using R.
    * kmeans: clustering and plotting using **kmeans**.
* RRSS (social networks): 
    * Airports: some examples of how to treat some data about networks (**graphs**, basically), in this case american airports network, including plots visualization.
* Text Mining: how to extract knoledge from texts. Those texts source can be, for example:
    * PDFs: how to extract texts from pdf files and work with the correct data structures to finally get some real interesting info.
    * Twitter: how to use the Twitter API and R to get tweets and process them to extract hidden knowledge.
* Visualization:
    * climate4R: document showing an example of a quite interesting package developed in Spain that allow us to generate climate related plots.

This course was attended at UMA (Universidad de Málaga), that's why all content is written in spanish, anyway I expect it to be useful since the real important content is the code itself.
